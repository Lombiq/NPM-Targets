# Lombiq NPM MSBuild Targets



[![Lombiq.Npm.Targets NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Lombiq.Npm.Targets?label=Lombiq.Npm.Targets)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Lombiq.Npm.Targets/)


## About

Provides automatic NPM package installation and a custom NPM command execution before building a .NET project. This way it is possible for example to manage assets (e.g. .scss files or images) in a folder that will be automatically compiled into the _wwwroot_ folder on build, which then can be excluded from the version control system.

Note, that these operations are optimized by running them only if the corresponding files have been changed.

Also see our [Gulp Extensions](https://github.com/Lombiq/Gulp-Extensions) library that contains some useful Gulp helpers.

## How to use

Install the [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Lombiq.Npm.Targets/) or if you use the project from a submodule, add the following lines to the csproj file where the _package.json_ file is. Make sure that the paths are pointing to the _Lombiq.Npm.Targets.props_ and _Lombiq.Npm.Targets.targets_ files of this project.

```
<Import Project="path\to\Lombiq.Npm.Targets\Lombiq.Npm.Targets.props" />
<Import Project="path\to\Lombiq.Npm.Targets\Lombiq.Npm.Targets.targets" />
```

The `npm install` (or `pnpm install`, see below) command will be executed but only if the _package.json_ file exists and has been changed since the last build (i.e. you un/installed packages or up/downgraded ones). Note that if you update NPM then the _package.json_ and _package-lock.json_ files can change on `npm install`; currently, [there's no way to prevent this](https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/564) (`npm ci` is much slower).

An `npm run dotnet-prebuild --if-present` script will be also executed during the build process which can be utilized to run a Gulp task for example. This will only happen if the files defined in `NpmDotnetPrebuildWatchedFiles` have changed (to achieve [incremental build](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/how-to-build-incrementally?view=vs-2019)). By default, these files contain *package.json*, *Assets/\*\*/\*.\**, *Scripts/\*\*/\*.\**, and *Styles/\*\*/\*.\**. If you want to adjust this list to cover your custom folders and files, override the given item group in your project file as follows:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <NpmDotnetPrebuildWatchedFiles Include="package.json;CustomFolder/**/*.*" />
</ItemGroup>
```

If you want to utilize this then add a `dotnet-prebuild` script to the _package.json_ file like this (`gulp build` is just an example of a command you can run; you can also run the default gulp command with just `gulp`):

```
{
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "dotnet-prebuild": "gulp build"
  }
}
```

Similarly, you can execute `npm run dotnet-postclean --if-present` via the `dotnet-postclean` script to clean up anything after an MSBuild `Clean`, for example:

```
"scripts": {
  "dotnet-postclean": "gulp clean"
}
```


## Using pnpm for package restore

[Pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) is a faster and more efficient package manager. If it's installed globally, then the module will use that instead of *npm* to restore packages.

To install *pnpm* globally run this command: `npm install pnpm -g`. Once it's complete, the module will automatically use that to restore packages.
